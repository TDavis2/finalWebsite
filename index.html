		<h3> About </h3>

		<p>
			Sports have had an immeasurable impact on my life since I was old enough to walk. Without sports I can say with absolute confidence I would not be the person that I am today. I have played multiple sports my entire life and to attribute my growth and development as a person to any one sport in particular would be misleading. I continue to play football in college, however I also continued my baseball career into the collegiate level before having to make the difficuly decision to stick with football over baseball. There are countless other sports that I won't focus on on this website that still hold a special place in my heart. This website is purely dedicated to the three sports that have made the most profound impact on me as a person throuh the coaches I have had, friends I have met and lessons I have learned along the way.
